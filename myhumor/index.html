    <h1 class="headeridfk">TW: suicidal thoughts, self harm </h1>
    <h2>if you're ok with that, scroll down</h2>
    <div class="fuckingcentered"> <p>
        it might shock you to know, that i am actually not doing ok mentally /hj <br>
        because of my *interesting* behaviour/humor, im constantly being gatekept/harassed into leaving communities that i really want to be part of. <br>
        that has led me into having suicidal thoughts, constantly hurting myself, and having close to 0 self confidence. <br>
        before you ask, yes. i am getting help, after my HRT request, im being monitored by multiple doctors, i am on antidepressants and im seeing multiple therapists <br>
        my way of handling with all of this is humor, hiding my depressed side with horrible jokes, which really arent funny, but its just my way of dealing with all of the things that are happening to me, which brings me to my point: <b>almost everything i do/say is sarcastic/ironic unless i state it otherwise. do not take most of my words seriously. i did not mean to offend anyone, i love you <3.</b>
        please dont act harshly with me, that really doesnt help my current state. i know its a lot to ask for, but i really dont have any ideas what to do
